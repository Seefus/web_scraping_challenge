# web_scraping_challenge
Module 11 Challanege:

I used the previous homework, and stack over flow to help with the Module.

I also use ChatGPT to help trouble shoot (like a faster google)

The first project was extremly simialr to the class examples. I did had some extra print text for readablitlity. 

For part 2 the table scrap was challenging and i could not follow homework i consulted Scrapfly and found the answer to my issue here:(https://scrapfly.io/blog/how-to-scrape-tables-with-beautifulsoup/)
